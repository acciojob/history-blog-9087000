		<h2>History</h2>
        <p><b>Main articles:</b> An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer with a head-up display, February 22, 1995. The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase "we blog" in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.</p>
